Cyclistic is a Chicago-based bike-share company that offers flexible ride options, including single-ride passes, day passes, and annual memberships. A large portion of Cyclistic’s users are “casual riders,” meaning they opt for single-use or day passes rather than purchasing annual memberships. However, financial analysis has shown that annual members are significantly more profitable to the business.

To support future growth, the marketing team aims to develop a data-driven strategy to convert more casual riders into annual members. As a junior data analyst, my task is to analyze historical ride data to identify differences in how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes. The insights gained from this analysis will inform targeted marketing strategies designed to increase membership conversions and drive long-term revenue.
